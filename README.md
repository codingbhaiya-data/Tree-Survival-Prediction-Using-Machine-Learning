# Tree-Survival-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

# Introduction
Tree survival is influenced by various ecological factors, including soil properties, light availability, and functional traits of seedlings. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the survival of tree seedlings based on these factors. By analyzing seedling traits, soil sources, and mycorrhizal associations, we aim to uncover key patterns that impact survival rates.

# Objectives
Develop a predictive model for tree survival based on ecological factors.
Preprocess and clean the dataset, handling missing values and categorical variables.
Analyze correlations between seedling traits and survival outcomes.
Implement multiple machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
Provide insights that can aid ecological research and conservation efforts.

# Key Outcome & Impact
Created a data-driven model to predict seedling survival probability.
Improved model performance using feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
XGBoost and Random Forest models demonstrated the highest accuracy in predicting survival rates.
Identified key ecological factors influencing tree survival, aiding in conservation planning.

#Insights and Recommendations
Seedling survival is significantly affected by mycorrhizal associations (AMF and EMF), with AMF showing a stronger correlation with defensive compounds.
Light availability plays a crucial role in determining survival, especially for certain species.
Soil conditions and seedling traits such as lignin and phenolics influence survival rates.
Future research can explore additional environmental variables and deep learning models for improved prediction accuracy.
